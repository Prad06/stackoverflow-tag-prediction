# StackOverflow Tag Prediction

This project aims to predict tags for StackOverflow questions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist users in categorizing their questions more accurately and efficiently.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature extraction, and model implementation.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files.
- `results/`: Evaluation results and performance metrics.
- `readme`: Project documentation.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies and run the models:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StackOverflow-Tag-Prediction.git
cd StackOverflow-Tag-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

To predict tags for new questions, use:

```bash
python predict.py --question "Your question here"
```

## Model

The model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Details about the model architecture and training process can be found in the `model` directory. (Will be shared on request, reach out to choudhari.pra@northeastern.edu)

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results` directory.
