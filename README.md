## Introduction

StackOverflow is a popular platform for developers to ask and answer questions. Each question is tagged with relevant keywords. This project focuses on predicting these tags based on the content of the questions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the StackOverflow archives. It includes questions, their corresponding tags, and other metadata.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

To predict tags for new questions, use:

```bash
python predict.py --question "Your question here"
```

## Model

The model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Details about the model architecture and training process can be found in the `model` directory.

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results` directory.
